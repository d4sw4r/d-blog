# d-blog
A blogging framework like Wordpress with symphony and angular

# motivation
I developed this blogging software back in 2016 or earlier  for educational purposes, when Angular became popular. It is based on Symphony2 with rest API and admin interface as the backend and Angular as the frontend.
There is no more development, but maybe it includes some nice examples how to split a project into two independent frameworks.
